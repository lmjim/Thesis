1. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of,,,,,

More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies.,,,,,
2. Death rates are flagged as -1 when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:,,,,,
